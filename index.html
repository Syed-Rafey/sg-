          <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
          <p>
            Learning to code is a powerful skill because it teaches you how to
            think logically and solve problems by breaking down complex tasks
            into manageable steps. Coding lets you be creative, too, opening the
            door to build things like games, websites, or even your own
            apps—it’s like having a digital toolbox to create whatever you can
            imagine. Plus, as technology becomes more important in nearly every
            job field, knowing how to code can give you a big advantage for
            future career opportunities. Coding also helps you understand the
            tech that’s all around us, from smartphones to video games, making
            you feel more in control of the digital world. And maybe the best
            part is that it’s fun! There’s a sense of satisfaction that comes
            from seeing your code come to life, working exactly as you
            planned.Coding lets you build things like games, apps, and websites.
            It’s like learning a new language where you create whatever you can
            imagine.Coding can be a lot of fun! It’s really satisfying to solve
            a problem, fix a bug, or see something you created actually work.
            Many jobs today and in the future will involve coding or technology,
            so learning it early gives you a big head start.
